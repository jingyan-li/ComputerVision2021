# CV Lab 5: Object Detection

In this exercise, I implemented:
• A bag-of-words image classifier that decides whether a test image contains a car (back view)
or not.
• A CNN-based image classification network on CIFAR-10 dataset for multi-class image classification.  

## Bag-of-words image classifier

In the method, we firstly sampled point per image and extracted features at each point by histogram of orientation (HOG). Then we constructed codebook for both positive dataset and negative dataset. The features in each dataset were clustered by KMeans, and the codebook represents the number of samples per each cluster. Finally we used bag-of-words to assign label to each image. For each image, we used the descriptors generated by HOG to generate the histogram (i.e., the frequency per each cluster). Then by comparing the bag-of-words histogram of a test image to the positive and negative examples, we assign the label of the test image by its nearest neighbor.

The parameter tuning and results are shown in the below table. Since we did not fix the random seed, the test accuracy changes a lot although we fixed the number of clusters. I just ran multiple times for the same set of parameters to ensure the robust result. 

| Number of clusters (K) | Number of iterations | Test Positive Acc | Test Negative Acc |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 20                     | 20                   | 0.8776            | 0.9400            |
| 20                     | 20                   | 0.9591            | 0.9200            |
| 20                     | 20                   | 0.8571            | 0.9000            |
| 13                     | 20                   | 0.9592            | 0.8200            |

## CNN-based image classification

In the task, we implemented a simplified VGG to conduct image classification.

In the model, we implemented five convolutional blocks and a classifier which contains fully connected layers  to make prediction. Note that given the kernel size of the convolutional layer is 3, the padding is set as 1 to ensure the output size.

Finally, the model achieves 81.87% on test dataset. Since there is some bugs in my tensorboard, I cannot open it successfully. Please find the losses and validation metrics in the log file.
